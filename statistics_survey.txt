Research Study: Attitudes Towards Statistics Part 2​

Please note that you are eligible to participate now even if you did not complete Phase 1 in January. ​ However, you are not eligible to participate if you’ve already filled out the survey in a previous semester/course.  

Dr. Alyssa Counsell in the Department of Psychology at Ryerson is interested in examining how attitudes towards statistics and statistical software change across the duration of one semester in a statistics course. Phase 2 of survey is available now. The online questionnaire should take about 30 minutes of your time.  For participating, you will be entered into a draw to win a $150 Amazon gift card. The survey is completely voluntary and confidential. In fact, your course director will never know whether you participated or how you answered the survey questions. More information about the study and researcher is included at:

The online survey is open until midnight on April 24, 2020.
